        <h3>UX Design & Web Development</h3>
        <p>I started to learn UX design and web development during my nine year career as an editor, as my desire to change the design and layout of the digital articles I was publishing grew. I've been hooked ever since and absolutely love the creative meets technical aspects of coding and UX design.   To date, I can confidently claim that I am proficient in my use of Figma and Adobe XD. I also can code using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and WordPress, with some basic knowledge of Javascript.  The list of skills is happily growing as we speak...</p>

        <h3>Writing & Editing</h3>
        <p>I started my first journal when I was six years old and have been writing ever since. My passion for writing grew throughout my childhood and into my adolescence, where by my senior year in high school I was editor-in-chief of my high school newspaper. In college I had my own column in the <em>Washington Square News</em>, and then later began freelance ghost writing after I completed graduate school. This eventually lead to my career as an editor, in which I have worked with numerous media companies editing closed captioning transcripts, various forms of texts, articles, and books.  </p>
